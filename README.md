# WIO-Troubleshooting-Program
This is a simple menu driven troubleshooting program for the WIO terminal board. 
This Program test the following:
1. The AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor
2. The built in Accelerometer (LIS3DHTR)
3. The built in Light sensor
4. The LCD screen of the board
5. The built in buzzer
6. The built in LED

The following will need libraries provided by SEEED in order to run the program.
The links for the libraries are provided below:
1. AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-AHT20-I2C-Industrial-Grade-Temperature&Humidity-Sensor/
2. Accelerometer (LIS3DHTR): https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_LIS3DHTR/tree/master
3. LCD Screen (TFT): https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_LCD

In general the SEEED wiki contains a lot of support for the WIO terminal with tutorials and libraries.
